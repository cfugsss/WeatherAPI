# WeatherAPI
Using weather api to get temperature and condition of any city.

# Description

This was one of the first projects (Feel like ive said that everytime ive posted something so far) using an api and also in python.
The code is pretty simple but mostly just getting my feet wet with api's and python. Overall, if I were to do this again
I might add a gui instead of entering the city in the terminal but hey it wokrs.
